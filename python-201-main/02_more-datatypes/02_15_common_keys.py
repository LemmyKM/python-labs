# Write a script that takes the following two dictionaries
# and creates a new dictionary by combining the common keys
# and adding the values of duplicate keys together.
# Use `for` loops to iterate over these dictionaries
# to accomplish this task.
#
# Example output:
# result = {"a": 3, "b": 2, "c": 7 , "d": 2}

from collections import Counter

dict_1 = {"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3}
dict_2 = {"a": 2, "c": 4 , "d": 2}

dict3 = Counter(dict_1) + Counter(dict_2)
print(dict3)

# for v in dict3.values():
#     print(v)
